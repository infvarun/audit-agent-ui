## Overview

This is a full-stack audit data collection application built with React + TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend. The application provides a wizard-based interface for setting up audit data collection processes, managing tool connectors, and generating audit reports. It uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data management and includes a comprehensive UI component system built with shadcn/ui.

- ADC (Application Dependency Checking)

## Data Flow

1. **Application Creation**: User creates application with basic metadata
2. **File Processing**: Data request files are uploaded and parsed for questions
3. **Connector Configuration**: External systems are configured with credentials
4. **Data Collection**: Automated data gathering from configured sources
5. **Result Generation**: Audit results are compiled and made available for download

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Components**: Extensive Radix UI component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for UI animations

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **AI Processing**: LangChain with OpenAI integration
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with Pydantic models
- **Database Connection**: asyncpg for PostgreSQL connections
- **File Processing**: openpyxl for Excel file handling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR on port 5173
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with Uvicorn and hot reload on port 5000
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Build**: Vite for frontend, Python for backend execution
- **Communication**: Direct API calls with CORS configuration

### Production
- **Frontend**: Static files built with Vite and served by Python FastAPI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with Uvicorn for production deployment
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy models with direct PostgreSQL connection
- **Environment**: DATABASE_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY required

### Build Process
- Frontend assets built to `dist/public`
- Python backend runs directly via start_python_backend.py
- Database schema created via SQLAlchemy metadata
- Static file serving integrated with Node.js proxy

The application follows a clean separation architecture with React frontend and Python backend communicating directly via CORS-enabled API calls. The frontend uses TypeScript for type safety while the backend uses Pydantic models for data validation, maintaining clear separation between frontend and backend concerns.
